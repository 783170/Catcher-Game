# Catcher-Game
A simple JavaScript game created as a final project at the end of my junior year of high school (spring 2021)

+ This is my first major project in JavaScript
+ It was coded using P5.JS
+ In this game you choose a side of the screen and it sets the theme of the game
+ Next droplets (diameter 20 pixels) fall from the top of the screen at a random location within 20 pixels of the edges
+ There are 30 total drops each falling faster than the previous drop
+ The catcher can only move and droplets can only be caught in the bottom quarter of the screen
+ Droplets are considered "caught" if the X and Y loaction of the droplet is with 20 pixels of all edges of the catcher box
+ Scores of 15 or less lose and 16 or more win
+ This game uses multiple sceens to enhance game play and allow for multiple rounds to be played with reseting the whole code
